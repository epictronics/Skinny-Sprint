# Skinny-Sprint v2
The Skinny Sprint is designed by VintageSupportService and free to use.
The design is based on the PC-Sprint released by Doug Severson in 1985.
The main difference from the PC-Sprint is that the Skinny Sprint will also fit other 8088 systems.
This version is tested on the 5150, 5155, 5160, and the PCjr so far. The list will be updated as I test it in other 8088 machines.
Feel free to send me an email if you have successfully tested the skinny sprint on systems not mentioned here epictronicsyt@gmail.com
